# Handbags and Purses Script for REDM

This project contains a script for REDM that allows players to equip handbags and purses as props. The script has been created using the VORP framework.

## Installation

1. Download the project.
2. Place the project folder in your RedM resource directory.
3. Add `ensure anz_handbags` to your `server.cfg` file.
4. You can run the SQL file and EDIT it (because of item's ID or desc) 

### Usage
After installing the script, players can equip handbags and purses as props.
Handbags are items you can give to player, they can be craft aswell.

#### Credits 

All credit goes to the VORP community. I just based this script on the work of @CocomonkSKY, and @MAKE and the help of Outsiders.
